📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment classification of e-commerce product reviews to automatically analyze customer feedback. Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for e-commerce platforms to improve products, enhance customer satisfaction, and make data-driven business decisions.

We developed a machine learning pipeline that transforms textual reviews into numerical representations using different text vectorization techniques and applies various classification models to predict sentiment categories:

🤖Positive

🤖Negative

🤖Neutral

🔑 Key Features

Multiple Text Vectorization Approaches:

👾Bag of Words (BoW) – Simple frequency-based representation.

👾Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip-gram) – Context-aware embeddings for semantic understanding.

👾GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) – Captures global statistical information from the corpus.

👾Ensemble Learning Models for Classification:

👾Random Forest – Robust tree-based ensemble method.

👾Gradient Boosting – Sequential learning with optimized error reduction.

👾AdaBoost – Boosting weak learners into strong predictors.

👾Multi-Class Sentiment Prediction: Classifies reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

🎯 Objective

The primary goal is to automate the sentiment analysis process for customer reviews on e-commerce platforms. This eliminates the need for manual review analysis and provides businesses with actionable insights into customer perceptions.
