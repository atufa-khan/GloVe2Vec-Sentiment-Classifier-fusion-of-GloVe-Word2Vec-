📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment classification of e-commerce product reviews to automatically analyze customer feedback. Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for e-commerce platforms to improve products, enhance customer satisfaction, and make data-driven business decisions.

We developed a machine learning pipeline that transforms textual reviews into numerical representations using different text vectorization techniques and applies various classification models to predict sentiment categories:

Positive

Negative

Neutral

🔑 Key Features

Multiple Text Vectorization Approaches:

Bag of Words (BoW) – Simple frequency-based representation.

Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip-gram) – Context-aware embeddings for semantic understanding.

GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) – Captures global statistical information from the corpus.

Ensemble Learning Models for Classification:

Random Forest – Robust tree-based ensemble method.

Gradient Boosting – Sequential learning with optimized error reduction.

AdaBoost – Boosting weak learners into strong predictors.

Multi-Class Sentiment Prediction: Classifies reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

🎯 Objective

The primary goal is to automate the sentiment analysis process for customer reviews on e-commerce platforms. This eliminates the need for manual review analysis and provides businesses with actionable insights into customer perceptions.

🧠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries & Tools:

🚀 Workflow

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Feature Extraction: Apply BoW, Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip-gram), and GloVe.

Model Training: Train Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost on extracted features.

Evaluation: Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Sentiment Prediction: Classify reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.

📊 Expected Outcome

An automated sentiment analysis system that can handle large volumes of customer reviews.

Comparative performance analysis of vectorization techniques and classification models.

A framework that can be integrated into real-world e-commerce platforms for better decision-making.
